# Introduction
Conducted a time series analysis to forecast the price of the Euro against the USD in the forex market.


# Files
The primary focus revolves around employing Python for predictive analytics on exchange rate data. The heart of the analysis can be found within "TS Project.ipynb", a Python-based Jupyter Notebook, which encompasses the entire data processing, visualization, and modeling process. For those who prefer a concise overview of the findings and methodologies, "TS Project.pdf" offers a distilled version of the notebook's content. Additionally, "TS Project.py" provides direct access to the main Python scripts used throughout the project, facilitating easy replication or adaptation of the work for future research or application.

# Analysis 
- Verified autocorrelation, stationarity, and seasonality properties of time series.
- Selected appropriate models and parameters based on time series properties.
- Evaluated model performance based on AIC and RMSE.
