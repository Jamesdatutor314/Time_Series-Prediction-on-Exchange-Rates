# Introduction
- Performed descriptive statistics analysis on pizza dataset utilizing summary statistics, histogram, scatter, line, and
box plots to identify variable distributions and correlations.
- Determined if there was a significant association between the price of pizza and toppings by implementing
inference statistics, including the Chi-Square test of Independence.
- Utilized feature engineering to manipulate and consolidate the raw pizza dataset into a standardized format for statistical analysis.

# Files
For the "presentation1" series, a Jupyter Notebook was created to detail the data analysis, utilizing Python libraries for effective data manipulation and visualization. This was further translated into a cPDF report and a reusable standalone Python script for broader accessibility. Similarly, the "project1" series emphasized feature engineering, with a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the exploration and generation of new dataset features. This work was also documented in a PDF format and accompanied by a modular Python script, ensuring both the depth of analysis and adaptability for various audiences and systems. The "files" folder contains the datasets.

# Conclusion
- Godfatherâ€™s Pizza is the most expensive pizza company compared to Pizza Hut, IMO, and Dominos.
- On average, the price of pizza is 16.32 dollars.
- Pizza Hut is the cheapest pizza company compared to the other three companies.
- Pizza toppings has an influence on the price of Pizza.
- The larger the diameter of the pizza, the higher the price will be.
