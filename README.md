# Introduction
Conducted a time series analysis to forecast the price of the Euro against the USD in the forex market.


# Files
For the "presentation1" series, a Jupyter Notebook was created to detail the data analysis, utilizing Python libraries for effective data manipulation and visualization. This was further translated into a cPDF report and a reusable standalone Python script for broader accessibility. Similarly, the "project1" series emphasized feature engineering, with a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the exploration and generation of new dataset features. This work was also documented in a PDF format and accompanied by a modular Python script, ensuring both the depth of analysis and adaptability for various audiences and systems. The "files" folder contains the datasets.

# Analysis 
- Verified autocorrelation, stationarity, and seasonality properties of time series.
- Selected appropriate models and parameters based on time series properties.
- Evaluated model performance based on AIC and RMSE.
